##Introduction
WiseSnail is the short name of Wise Sensor Network Abstract Interactive Layer. It is a layer to define the topology and behavior of sensor network. A complete device represented in WiseSnail includes one virtual gateway, one sensor connectivity interface and several sensor devices. WiseSnail provides a form-like array which we call it infospec array to define the parameters of sensor device. And a form-like data array updates your real time data. So, you can easy to represent your device by creating several arrays.
